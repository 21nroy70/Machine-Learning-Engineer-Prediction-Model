# Machine-Learning-Engineer-Prediction-Model
# Task:
I have been given a dataset where it consists of the number of the observed scanned receipts for each day in the year 2021. Based on this prior knowledge, I have developed and optimized an algorithm which can predict the approximate number of the scanned receipts for each month of 2022.

I have implemented several mathematical calculations and the use of linear algebra and matrix operations to help develop several functions in the use of machine learning and to be able to accuractly predict the scanned recipients for each month of 2022. 

The program I have created is split into 2 parts:
Part 1 is assuming there is no prior data and information to train and find the prior mean and standard deviation. Thus, I have only used the information file that includes information for each day in 2021 and the recipient count for each, respectively. This part is kind of an exploration in which I treated it as a way to see the data through the use of visualizations and have further created 9 models which increase in polynomial degree. For example, model 1 is the simple linear regression model, where we have an x (in thus case, Day_of_Year) as the coefficent and the response is y (in this case, recipient count), and model 9 is a 9th degree polynomial using the coefficent we were provided with. In order to make this simplier and more convient to read, I have transformed both the explantory (x) variable and response (y) variable - where the Date is labeled 1 - 365 to represent each day of the year. Likewise, the response is transformed into millions, so instead of having 7,500,000 - we would have 7.50. This make it easier to read and interpret. The part 1 file guides through the visualizations, code, model selection, and interpretation of the steps I have done and completed in the first phase of this machine learning engineering tasks.
